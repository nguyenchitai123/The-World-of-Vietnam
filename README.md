# 💫About Me :
Hello everyone, I am from Vietnam, and I’m excited to share a project I’m working on! I’m currently developing a Minecraft mod that aims to bring the rich culture, iconic landmarks, and unique vehicles of Vietnam into the world of Minecraft. This mod will introduce elements inspired by Vietnamese traditions, architecture, and everyday life, allowing players to immerse themselves in the vibrant and diverse aspects of Vietnam’s heritage within the game. From traditional Vietnamese structures to culturally significant items and transportation methods, the mod is designed to celebrate and showcase the beauty of Vietnam in a creative and interactive way.
